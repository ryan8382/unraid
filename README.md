unRaid docker installers

The following Docker apps are open source and ones that we use at work. I have a need to use these to manage some machines 
for people and figure it would be a good idea to post this for the community. 

The software Sal is developed by Graham Gilbert.

The SAL docker app requires 2 docker containers to run. It requires Postgres-Sal and SAL itself. 

In the future I plan to add Puppet and a Munki Repo container.
